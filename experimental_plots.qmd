# Selection of experimental plots  

## Experimental design  

The experimental design for the red spruce monitoring effort. A circular experimental plot of radius 16m was established at the restoration site for reforestation monitoring and to assess the performance of individual sources. Each experimental plot consisted of forty plants from a single source to reflect the planting density of the reforestation activity. These single source experimental plots were marked with a central metal rod capped with a bright orange cap along with GPS coordinates to make it easier for tracking down these plots for future monitoring efforts.

## Randomization of plots
Software: [ArcGIS Pro v.2.6.0.](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/get-started.htm)  

*Create a project*  

*Insert -> New Map – to open the map viewer*  

*Insert -> Layout – to open the layout of the map, so that it can be exported   properly*  

###	Map pane   

- *Select Map ribbon -> Basemap -> USA topo maps* (or any base map of choosing) \


- *Select the shape file on the left navigation pane -> Appearance ribbon at top -> slide the slider to choose the transparency ->* `set to 20%`  \


- *Create random points within the Polygon/shape file*  \


  `Geoprocessing -> Toolboxes -> Data Management Tools -> Sampling -> Create random points`

:::: {layout="[ 55, 45 ]"}

::: {#first-column}

**Set the settings as shown here**   
1.	Output location: Place to store the shape files for the new polygon object  
2.	Output point feature class: Name of the new point/ shape file to be created  
3.	Number of Points – “Long”    
4.	Enter the number of points needed    
5.	Minimum allowed distance – Linear Unit  
6.	Enter the distance between the points in meters   

*Switch to environment tab*  
1.	Change output coordinate system to the layer you are working with currently.  

  `Click Run` 

Re-run the process till you get acceptable locations for the plots

::::


**Add buffer around the points**    

This step is done to see how much each plot take place within an area and to make sure the plot boundaries do not overlap.  

`Geoprocessing -> Analysis Tools -> Proximity -> Buffer`  

- Steps are similar to creating the random points as described above.  
- Set buffer distance (radius of the plot) + 2m as buffer for each point.  

**Merge points together**      
`Geoprocessing -> Data Management Tools -> General -> Merge`  


**Add coordinates**     
`Geoprocessing -> Data Management Tools -> Features -> Add XY Coordinates`  


**Add labels to the points**  
`Select layer -> Click Labeling -> Label`  

- Set Field to column with ID that needs to displayed.  

- Use Callout to add the label to the points.  

- Set Label Placement to Basic Offset Point.  

**Change color based on the naming convention:**  
`Appearance -> Symbology -> Unique Values`  

- Set Field to ID column.  
- Click the expression builder button next to Field.  
  `Left($feature.”ID_column”, “number of letters/numers to select”)`  
  
- Click Verify to check the output  

**Convert to shapefile**  
  `Geoprocessing -> Conversion -> Feature Class To Shapefile`  
  
**Export attribute table**  
  `Geoprocessing -> Conversion -> Table To Excel`  
  
  
### Layout pane  

**Add map**  
`Insert -> Map Frame ->  Map`  
- Click on the map frame and Activate in order to interact with the map  
- To deactivate the map frame  
- Activated Map Frame ribbon -> Close Activation  

**Add compass**  
Select the Insert tab within the layout pane -> North Arrow ->Arc GIS North 13 arrow  

**Add border to map**  
- Stay within the insert tab.  
- Click on the map frame.  
- Click `Grid`    
- Click `Black Horizontal Label Graticule`  
- Click `"Map Frame” tab -> Gridlines -> Set color to “No color”`  

**Add legend**  
`Insert tab -> Legend -> Draw the legend`  
- Click `Legend -> Format -> Choose text`  
- Right click on Legend on the left navigation pane -> Properties  
- Change settings accordingly  
- Select “Show properties..” under Legend items  
  - Select Items to show on the legend on the navigation pane check box    
- Once done; right click on the legend layer -> Convert to graphics  
  - Now remove items/edit items freely
